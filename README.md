# Bee-colony-optimization
The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm is inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It simulates the process of bees searching for food to solve complex optimization problems, like allocating resources efficiently.  It uses three types of bees — Employed, Onlooker, and Scout — to balance solution refinement and discovery.
